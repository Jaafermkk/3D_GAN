# 3D GAN Project

## Overview
This project implements a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. The aim is to generate 3D voxel representations of objects from random noise.

## Features
- Utilizes a 3D GAN architecture to generate voxel data.
- Supports training with customizable hyperparameters.
- Includes utility functions for data loading, visualization, and saving generated models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- TensorBoardX
- Visdom


### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D_GAN.git
   cd 3D_GAN

### Usage
1-Prepare your dataset of 3D voxel data in the specified format.
2-Modify the params.py file to set your hyperparameters and data paths.
3-Train the GAN model

### Training
-The training script will save model checkpoints and generated images at specified intervals.
-Adjust the hyperparameters in params.py to control training behavior.

### Testing
-The testing script generates outputs based on the trained model.
-You can visualize the results using Visdom if configured.
